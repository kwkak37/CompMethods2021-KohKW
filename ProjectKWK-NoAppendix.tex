\begin{abstract}
This paper builds upon \cite{IM14} on vote switches towards financial deregulation by US legislators. I measure the effect of close elections on US legislators on switching their votes towards financial deregulation in Congress bills. I aim to distinguish between vote switches towards financial deregulation because of voters' general interests (especially after the Global Financial Crisis of 2007) versus the financial industry's special interests and the industry's campaign contributions and lobbying expenditures towards legislators in close elections.

How do legislators in close elections vote differently on financial deregulation compared to legislators in sure elections? I use data from \cite{IM14} to answer this question.


\hypertarget{The-Problem}{}

\section{The Problem}

\indent I aim to answer part of a wider question of whether legislators, in their legislative activities, are influenced by lobbying and campaign contributions from private interests. Take the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate (FIRE) industry as an example. As FIRE firms wish to increase the amount of loans that they can make to consumers, they may try to influence legislators to change their stances (and hence votes) towards financial deregulation that allows more lending activities. An ideal study would have multiple bills of the same type of financial regulation, such that we can identify which legislators switch their votes or co-sponsorship towards financial deregulation. In the case of votes, a legislator would initially vote against financial deregulation in an earlier reincarnation $R$ of a bill group $B$, then vote for financial deregulation in a later reincarnation of the same bill group $B$. In the case of co-sponsorship, a legislator would initially not co-sponsor an earlier reincarnation, then co-sponsor a later reincarnation.\\

\indent \cite{IM14} look at the case of U.S. Congressional legislators from 1999 to 2006. To do so, they focus on aggregate lobbying expenditures by the FIRE industry on six groups ($B = 1, 2, \dots, 6$, in total composed of 47 bills. They set as their dependent variable a dummy variable on whether the Congressional legislators' voting records or bill co-sponsorship status \textit{switched} towards financial deregulation (i.e. easing lending activities to consumers). \\

\cite{IM14} argue that their results, that lobbying expenditures make legislators more likely to switch their votes towards financial deregulation, is a correlational result and therefore cannot be taken as causation from either of these reasons. I attempt to provide at least a partial answer by introducing new variables, including one for whether a legislator has been in or will be facing a close election. I also include other variables to support the regression strategies that can differentiate between voters' public scrutiny and the financial industry's special interests.

\indent The next step is to identify variation in the general interest of voters on financial (de)regulation. There are several possible ways of doing this.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I would extend the existing dataset of \cite{IM14}, from 1999 to 2006, to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) starting in 2007 and beyond. Given the perceived increase in voters' general interests against financial deregulation after the GFC, the changes in general interest allow me to identify their effect on legislators switching their vote towards financial deregulation, and thus the effect of special interests on legislators' votes as well.
    \item I would include a measure of ``media congruence'' as named by Snyder and Stromberg (2010). Media congruence is defined as the geographical alignment between local news markets and congressional districts. Intuitively, if a congressional district is more geographically aligned with the local news markets, then the legislator representing that district may be covered by the local newspapers more closely than otherwise. The greater public scrutiny incentivizes legislators to vote more on behalf of his/her district voters and less on behalf of special interests such as the FIRE industry. Snyder and Stromberg (2010) include a dataset with an index of media congruence for all Congressional districts from 1984 to 2006.

\subsection{Dependent Variable}\label{subsec:DependentVariable}

\input{\TableDir/DepVar}

\subsection{Election Closeness}\label{subsec:ElectionCloseness}

Compared to the original \cite{IM14} paper, I add the new variable of ``Election Closeness'' as the main focus of this paper. I define ``election closeness'' for each legislator $i$ and bill $BR$, denoted as $X_{iBR}$, as the degree to which the legislator has faced (past) or will face (future) a close election. Note the two possible ways of looking at election closeness: through the past election(s) of the legislator, or to the (immediately next) future election of the legislator. Meanwhile, the measure of future election closeness
\\

Past election closeness is defined simply, in this paper, as the percentage margin of victory of the legislator in the last election before a vote on a bill $BR$. I denote this variable as $X^{P}_{iBR}$. As a concrete example, assume that legislator $A$ won his/her last election with 49,000 votes against the runner-up, who got 47,000 votes in a congressional election of a total of 100,000 votes, and that the remaining 4,000 votes all went to third-party, independent, and write-in votes. In this case, legislator $A$'s margin of victory is $(49,000-47,000)/100,000 = 2\%$. There are two important characteristics of this variable: first, $X^{P}_{iBR}$ must necessarily be greater than zero, as the legislator must have won at least one more vote than the runner-up. Second, $X^{P}_{iBR}$ is the same across all bills $BR$ during the same congress $C$, as legislator $i$ has only one value of past election closeness at any given congress $C$ and all the bills therein. \\

Ideally, future election closeness may be defined as the expected margin of victory in the next (future) election of the legislator. I denote this variable as $X^{F}_{iBR}$. The future expected margin of victory of an as-of-yet undecided election can be proxied by results of election polls. Since most future congressional elections at any given electoral cycle have at least one polling result, and in most cases more than one, $X^{F}_{iBR}$ can differ across bills $BR$ even in the same congress $C$.
